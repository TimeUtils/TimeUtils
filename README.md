# Welcome to Time Utils Project

The ideia for this repository came up after a small freelance that i had, but now i searching for utils to put into this page to make it useful for nomprogrammers users.

# Techs

Basically, it's just html, css and js, with no framework and that kind of useful stuff (just bootstrap because the css is borrowing).
It is just a mvp and a simple project.

## So lets start

To run this pice of code you need to:
1) Open the index in your browser
2) Allow js
3) Why you are reading this? its so simple, go ahead

## When it start

It should work, if not, well, the world is burning, or someone (me) make an unstable push to main fork :(
